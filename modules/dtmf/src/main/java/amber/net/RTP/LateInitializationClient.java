/**
*   This class encapsulates the client side functionality of the late initialization

*   port to initialize a new seesion with the server. The server assigns the client 
*   a newly generated port number (which is available) to connect to, so that
*   the initial port is freed for other client requests. The client closes that connection
*   and spawns a new thread connecting to the port number assigned by the server and
*   the client and the server go through a series of "handshaking" signals which maintain
*   the state of the server and the client. 
*   The server transfers all the data to the client and sends a bye to the client which closes
*   the connection on that particular port and the port is freed up.
