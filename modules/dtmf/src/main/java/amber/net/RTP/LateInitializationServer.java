/**
*   This class encapsulates the server side functionality of the late initialization
*   procedure. It starts the server thread which monitors the activity on a specified
*   port. It waits for client connections on this initial port - portToMonitor. All clients
*   initially connect to this port when they want to initiate a new session with the
*   server. As soon as the server gets a client request in this initial port, it assigns
*   the client a newly generated port number (which is available) to connect to, so that
*   the initial port is freed for other client requests. 
*   The server spawns a new thread connecting to the randomly generated port number and
*   the client and the server go through a series of "handshaking" signals which maintain
*   the state of the server and the client. 
*   The server transfers all the data to the client and sends a bye to the client which closes
*   the connection on that particular port and the port is freed up.
